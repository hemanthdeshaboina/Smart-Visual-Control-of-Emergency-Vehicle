Smart Visual Control of Emergency Vehicle Using YOLO Model


I. Introduction                                                                                                                                               
    The "Smart Visual Control of Emergency Vehicle using YOLO Model" project aims to develop a system for detecting and managing emergency vehicles in real-time traffic scenarios. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, the system can identify emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire trucks, and police cars, and implement control measures to facilitate their swift movement through traffic.

III. Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-visual-control-emergency-vehicle.git
cd smart-visual-control-emergency-vehicle
pip install -r requirements.txt

IV. Usage
To use the pre-trained YOLO model for detecting emergency vehicles, follow these steps:
Download the pre-trained model: Ensure you have the YOLO weights file (yolov3.weights) and the configuration file (yolov3.cfg).
Run the detection script:
python src/evaluate.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg --output_path path/to/output/image.jpg
This will process the input image and save the output with detected emergency vehicles highlighted.

V. Training the Model
To train the YOLO model on a custom dataset, follow these steps:
Prepare the dataset: Ensure your dataset is annotated in YOLO format and placed in the data/annotations directory.
1. Preprocess the data:
python src/data_processing.py --input_dir data/raw --output_dir data/processed
2. Train the model:
python src/train.py --data_dir data/processed --config_path models/yolo/yolov3.cfg --weights_path models/yolo/yolov3.weights --output_dir models/trained_model

VI. Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained model:
Run the evaluation script:
python src/evaluate.py --data_dir data/processed --weights_path models/trained_model/yolov3.weights
This script will provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
